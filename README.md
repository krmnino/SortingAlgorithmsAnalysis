# CS240A Group Project
### Data Sorting Project
The aim of this project is to use multiple sorting algorithms to test their performance using datasets of different sizes. Datasets are generated using a script and stored in a text file, one data point per line. We will evaluate the number of comparisons, swap, and execution time between algorithms when sorting datasets.
